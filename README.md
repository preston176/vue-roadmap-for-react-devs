# 🧭 Vue.js Project-Based Learning Roadmap (For React Devs)

Welcome! This is a carefully crafted roadmap to help React developers transition into the **Vue** ecosystem through **real, non-generic projects**.

 If you're a React developer and you're ready to become a 10x Vue developer, this roadmap is your new best friend 🚀

---

## 📌 Goals

- Learn Vue 3 and Composition API deeply
- Understand Vue Router, Pinia (Vuex alt), and ecosystem tools
- Master Single File Components (SFCs)
- Build REAL apps, not another boring To-Do list
- Gain enough knowledge to contribute to Vue OSS or land a Vue role

---

## 🧱 Phase 1: Vue Fundamentals

> Focus: Vue Syntax, Reactivity, Directives, Components, Props, Events

### 🔧 Project 1: GitHub Readme Snippets Visualizer
**What it does:** Paste your GitHub README, and it previews how the markdown + code snippets would look in different themes (dark/light/custom).  
**Tech:** Vue 3, Composition API, Prism.js for code highlighting  
**Why:** Great for mastering template syntax, conditional rendering, slots, and lifecycle hooks.

---

## 🧩 Phase 2: Vue Router + Component Communication

> Focus: Routing, Dynamic Routes, Props, Event Bus or Emits

### 🔧 Project 2: Developer Portfolio Builder (with Templates)
**What it does:** Users select templates and dynamically build a portfolio (with different pages: About, Projects, Contact).  
**Tech:** Vue Router, Dynamic Routing, Pinia (state), Composition API  
**Why:** Teaches routing, props drilling, dynamic components, and state sync.

---

## 📦 Phase 3: State Management with Pinia

> Focus: Centralized state, stores, modular design

### 🔧 Project 3: AI Flashcards App with Smart Review
**What it does:** Users can generate flashcards using AI and review them using spaced repetition.  
**Tech:** Pinia, OpenAI API (optional), Composition API  
**Why:** Helps grasp store design, state persistence, computed props, async actions.

---

## 🎨 Phase 4: Vue Transitions + Animations

> Focus: Transitions, animations, custom components

### 🔧 Project 4: Interactive Timeline Resume Builder
**What it does:** Drag-and-drop interface to create timelines of your work or school journey.  
**Tech:** Vue 3, VueDraggable or SortableJS, GSAP/Anime.js  
**Why:** Strengthens transitions, DOM manipulations, and third-party Vue integrations.

---

## 🧪 Phase 5: Testing + Best Practices

> Focus: Unit Testing, Component Testing, CI/CD

### 🔧 Project 5: Component Playground & Testing Lab
**What it does:** Create and test reusable components (e.g., buttons, cards, modals) with preview and test cases.  
**Tech:** Vitest + Vue Test Utils  
**Why:** Builds muscle memory in writing tests and understanding CI setup.

---

## 🌐 Phase 6: Server-side + SSR with Nuxt 3

> Focus: Nuxt, Server-side rendering, SEO, API fetching

### 🔧 Project 6: Dev Blog + Snippet Vault (with Markdown Editing)
**What it does:** Full-featured blog with ability to save code snippets and docs like Notion.  
**Tech:** Nuxt 3, Markdown-it, Content Module  
**Why:** Prepares you for fullstack Vue and real-world app structures.

---

## 🌍 Bonus Phase: Contribute to Vue Ecosystem

### 🔧 OSS Sprint
- Pick a small bug or feature request in: `vueuse`, `vitepress`, `pinia`, or `nuxt`
- Document your journey in a public repo or blog
- Share it on GitHub Discussions or Twitter with the Vue community

---

## 🛠 Tools to Learn Along the Way

| Tool | Why it matters |
|------|----------------|
| **Vite** | Fast dev server used in Vue ecosystem |
| **Vue DevTools** | Time-travel debugging and reactive tracing |
| **Volar** | VSCode extension for Vue with TypeScript |
| **Vitest** | Testing framework like Jest but optimized for Vite |

---

## ⭐️ Star-worthy Tips

- Document your journey for each project: include screenshots, lessons, challenges, and what you learned.
- Make a clean README for every project. Include `Getting Started`, `Tech Stack`, and a `Demo` if possible.
- Share your GitHub repo on Dev.to, Hashnode, or LinkedIn.
- Use good commit messages and PR descriptions if open-sourcing.
